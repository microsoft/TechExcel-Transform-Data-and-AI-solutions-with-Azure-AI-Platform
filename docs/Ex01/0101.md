    {: .important } 
    > The hub is the overarching development environment. Access to the hub allows you to modify the infrastructure, create new hubs, and create projects. Projects exist within a hub and can have different permissions and resources. When granted access to a project, the user is also automatically granted **Reader** level access to the associated hub. The user is also granted the **Inference Deployment Operator** role, which allows them to create deployments on the resource group that the project is in.
