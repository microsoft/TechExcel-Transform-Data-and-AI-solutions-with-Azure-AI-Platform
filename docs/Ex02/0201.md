# Task 01: Manage compute at the hub level 

## Introduction

To ensure smooth execution of AI workflows, Adatum must provision appropriate compute resources. Managing compute at the hub level allows for efficient processing of AI models and prompt flows, supporting the company's AI-driven chatbot and customer interaction initiatives.

## Description

In this task, you'll create a compute instance to use in running prompt flows. This ensures the necessary processing power is available to execute AI workloads effectively.

## Success Criteria

- The compute instance has been created and is running.

## Learning Resources

- [Create and manage prompt flow compute sessions in Azure AI Foundry portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/create-manage-compute-session)

## Key Tasks

### 01: Create the compute instance resource in hub

    > A compute instance is a virtual machine that is used to run prompt flows within projects. It’s created at the hub level and accessible by any projects with proper permissions.

1. Name the compute instance **aicompute1**, leave the other settings as default,  then select **Review + Create**.

1. Once the compute instance is created, it should show a status of **Running**. 

    {: .important }
    > The compute instance can be used for various different tasks such as creating an index, building an open source model, or executing complex prompt flows. While you won't need to use the compute instance in this lab, this is how one would be created for any of those use cases.
