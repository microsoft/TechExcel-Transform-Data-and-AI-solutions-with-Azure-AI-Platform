    > The prompt flow page contains two main panes. On the left is the flow  pane, which allows you to add and configure new flows with LLMs, prompts, and various Python tools. The right pane contains a graph, allowing you to easily visualize the flow of different nodes. The graph will update dynamically as updates are made in the flow pane.
